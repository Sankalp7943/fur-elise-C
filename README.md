# fur-elise-C
Program written in Turbo C to play Fur Elise by Ludwig Van Beethoven. C function named 'sound' targets the speaker to play a specific frequency which was input based on the song's musical notes. It was made for fun during office time. 
Do not remove the 'nosound' function or else system will continue playing that last note even when program is closed.
